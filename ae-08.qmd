## Data prep

First, clean/tidy/reshape the data so that it can be used to create the improved plots from the slides.

Some notes:

-   Drop any responses with `NA`s

-   The questions of interest are the only ones with `_3_` in their names:

    -   `overall_quality_of_services_3_01`: Overall quality of services provided by the city

## Starting point

Then, make the simple stacked bar chart in Step 1.

#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 10

# add code here
```

## 100% bar chart

Finally, improve the visualization above as the 100% bar chart in Step 2.

```{r}
#| label: likert-100-step-2
#| fig-asp: 0.5
#| fig-width: 10

# add code here
